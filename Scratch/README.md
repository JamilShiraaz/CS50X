# Scratch

This is my Week 0, Problem Set

I have made a small Buggy game using Scratch.
In this I have tried to keep it in the parameter:

+Keep project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.

+Keep project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).

+Keep project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.

+Keep project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.

+Keep project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Oscartime and Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game.
